# Synchronized Requests

A SynchronizedRequest can terminate (send the last http header byte then close the socket) the request at exactly one moment using the 'terminate' method.

It can be useful if the goal is to ensure that multiple requests are processed by the server at exactly one specific moment.

## Use case
